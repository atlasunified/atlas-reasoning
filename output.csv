"A farmer has just noticed that one of his cows is missing. He realizes that either the cow has wandered off or has been stolen. How can he use deductive reasoning to figure out what happened to the cow?","- Assume that the cow has wandered off. Search within the farm for the missing cow. If it's found on the farm, the assumption was true. - However, if the cow is not on the farm, then we need to consider the other possibility.  - Assume the cow has been stolen. Look for signs of theft, like broken fences or footprints. If signs are found, it indicates that the cow might have been stolen. - Conversely, if no signs of theft are found, then it's safe to say the cow has wandered off and hasn't been stolen.","If the farmer finds the cow within the farm, it wandered off"

"You have two eggs and a 100-floor building. You want to find the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped. What is the minimum number of drops you need to make, and what strategy should you use?","- Start by dropping an egg from the 50th floor. If the egg breaks, you know the highest floor where it won't break is between 1 and 49. If it doesn't break, you know the highest floor is between 51 and 100. - Take the group of floors where the highest floor still might be and repeat the process. For example, if the egg didn't break when dropped from the 50th floor, drop it from the 75th floor. If it breaks, the highest floor is between 51 and 74. If it doesn't break, the highest floor is between 76 and 100. - Keep dividing the remaining floors in half and dropping an egg to identify the highest floor.","You can find the highest floor in a maximum of 14 drops (starting at 50, then 25, 13, 7, 4, 2, and 1)"

The swimmer who finished second beat the swimmer who finished third. 3. There were no ties.","- There are five possible positions for each swimmer: first, second, third, fourth, or fifth. - From clue 1, the swimmer who finished first cannot possibly be in fifth place. This means the swimmer who finished fifth is actually fourth or fifth. - From clue 2, the swimmer who finished second cannot possibly be in third place. This means the swimmer who finished third is actually third or fourth. - Using these deductions, we can create a table with the framework 'First - Second - Third/Fourth - Fourth/Fifth - Fifth/Third'. - From clue 1, we know that the swimmer who finished first beat the swimmer who finished fifth, so the table could be 'First - Second - Third/Fourth - Fourth/Fifth - Fifth/Third'. - But from clue 3, we know there were no ties, which means the fifth and third positions cannot be shared. Therefore, the order must be 'First - Second - Third - Fourth - Fifth'.","The order of finish is First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth"

"If A and B are true, can we deduce the truth value of (A implies B) or (B implies A)?","- If A and B are both true, then A implies B and B implies A are both true.     - If A implies B is true, then the antecedent (A) can be false while the consequent (B) is true. However, if B implies A is true, then A must be true if B is true. Therefore, (B implies A) is stronger than (A implies B).","(B implies A) is true, but (A implies B) may or may not be true"
"If (A and B) implies C, can we deduce that (A implies C) or (B implies C)?","- We can use a truth table to check if the implication holds true for all possible truth values of A, B, and C.

"Given that (A and B) implies C, and that D implies B, can we deduce that (A and D) implies C?","- We know that (A and B) implies C, which means if (A and B) is true, then C must also be true.     - We also know that D implies B, which means if D is true, then B must also be true.     - If we can show that (A and D) is true whenever (A and B) is true, then we can conclude that (A and D) implies C. This is because if (A and D) implies C holds true whenever (A and B) implies C holds true, then the two implications are logically equivalent and can be interchanged.     - To show that (A and D) is true whenever (A and B) is true, we need to show that A is true whenever both A and B are true, and that D is true whenever B is true. We know that D implies B, so whenever B is true, D must also be true, which satisfies the second condition. For the first condition, we need to assume A is false and show that (A and B) implies C is false. However, we know that A and B are both true, which makes (A and B) implies C true by definition. Therefore, we cannot find a counterexample where (A and D) are both true while (A and B) implies C is false.","(A and D) implies C"
"Given that A implies (B or C), and that B implies D, can we deduce that A implies (C or D)?","- We need to show that if A is true, then (C or D) must also be true, given that A implies (B or C) and B implies D.      - We know that if B is true, then D must also be true.      - If (B or C) is true, then either B is true or C is true (or both). If B is true, then D must also be true. If C is true, then (C or D) is true.      - Therefore, if A is true and (B or C) is also true, then either (C or D) is true or D is true (because of the implication B implies D). Therefore, A implies (C or D) must be true.","A implies (C or D)"
