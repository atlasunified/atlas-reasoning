"Are moral facts objective or subjective?","- Objective moral facts exist independent of anyone's opinion or belief.  - If objective moral facts exist, then they must be grounded in something external to individual opinions.  - If subjective moral beliefs are the only basis for moral facts, then moral disagreement cannot be resolved.  - There can never be unanimous agreement about subjective matters.  - Therefore, moral facts must be objective and grounded in something beyond subjective opinion.","Moral facts are objective and grounded in something beyond individual opinion or belief"
"Does consciousness survive the death of the body?","- If consciousness exists only in the brain, then it cannot survive the death of the body.  - However, there is evidence that consciousness exists independently of the brain, such as near-death experiences.  - Therefore, consciousness may be able to survive the death of the body.  - However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove or disprove this.","Whether consciousness survives the death of the body is uncertain and cannot be proven or disproven definitively"
"Is knowledge of the external world possible?","- Knowledge is justified true belief.  - Justification requires evidence or reasons.  - However, all evidence or reasons come from our perceptions and experiences, which can be deceiving.  - Therefore, we cannot be certain that our knowledge of the external world is true or justified.  - We can only have tentative or probable beliefs.","Knowledge of the external world is uncertain and can only be tentatively or probably believed in"
"Is truth relative to culture or individuals?","- If truth is relative, then there is no objective standard by which to judge competing claims.  - However, people in different cultures accept different beliefs as true, which seem incompatible.  - Therefore, truth cannot be wholly relative to culture or individuals.  - However, there may be some relative aspects of truth, such as norms or values.","Truth cannot be entirely relative to culture or individuals, but there may be some relative aspects to it"
"Can we know anything beyond sense experience?","- Empiricism claims that knowledge comes only from sense experience.  - However, there are rationalist arguments that claim some knowledge can be acquired through purely intellectual processes, such as the existence of mathematical truths.  - Therefore, we can know some things beyond sense experience.  - However, this does not mean that sense experience is unimportant.","Some knowledge can be acquired beyond sense experience, but it should be supplemented by empirical observation and experience"
"Can we prove that the external world exists?","- Solipsism claims that we cannot know anything beyond our own minds.  - However, the existence of a physical world can be inferred from our sensory experiences.  - If the external world did not exist, then our sensory experiences would be random and non-coherent.  - Therefore, the external world must exist.  - However, there is no way to prove this conclusively.","While we cannot prove the existence of the external world, we can infer its existence through our sensory experiences"
"Is existence a predicate?","- The ontological argument claims that existence is a necessary predicate of God.  - However, there are objections to this claim, such as the 'no-ontological-commitment' principle which states that the existence of something cannot be a property of it because existence is a prerequisite for being a thing in the first place.  - Therefore, existence cannot be a predicate.  - However, other philosophers argue that existence can be a predicate in certain contexts.","The question of whether existence can be a predicate is a debated topic and depends on the context in which it is being considered"

"P, Q, and R are three propositions. If P implies Q, Q implies R, and R implies P, what are the truth values of P, Q, and R?","If P implies Q, and Q implies R, then P implies R (transitivity of implication). If R implies P, then P and R have the same truth value. Therefore, P, Q, and R all have the same truth value. Since they are either all true or all false, we can assume one as true and the other two as false to satisfy all given statement. Hence, P, Q, and R are all false.","False, False, False  3"
"If P implies Q and P is true, is Q necessarily true?","If P implies Q, then Q is true whenever P is true. In this case, P is true, so Q may be either true or false. We don't know for sure that Q is true.","Not Necessarily  4"

"If (P and Q) implies (R or S) is true, and P implies R is true, what is the truth value of (P and ¬S) implies ¬Q?","If (P and Q) implies (R or S) is true, then either (P and Q) is false, or (R or S) is true. If P implies R is true, then either P is false, or P is true and R is true. The truth value of (P and ¬S) implies ¬Q can be determined using the contrapositive: if Q is true, then (P and ¬S) is true and ¬Q is false; if (P and ¬S) implies ¬Q is true, then Q must be false. Therefore, we only need to consider the case where Q is false. If (R or S) is true, then either R is true or S is true. Since P implies R is true, if P is true, then R is true and S is false. Therefore, (P and Q) is false, and so (P and Q) implies (R or S) is vacuously true. Hence, (P and ¬S) implies ¬Q is also vacuously true.","True"
